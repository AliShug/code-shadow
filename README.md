# CodeShadow

CodeShadow uses [Acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn) to provide at-a-glance structural annotations for JavaScript code, helping you quickly navigate files you know, and rapidly understand those you don't. It keeps enclosing statements visible as you scroll, helping you maintain awareness, and allows you to jump up to those statements with a single click.

This is a new package, in beta - please report any issues you find!
